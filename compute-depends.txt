computed field doens't get stored on database, unless you set store=True, but, doing so, we have to set @api.depends on function signature, doing changes on real time.
compute fields, by default are readonly = True.

onchange api can changes fields on real time, but can't depends from another model's field.

api.constrains only will be displayed on creation, not in real time.
