	An XML ID is a string that refers to a record in the database. The IDs themselves are
records of the ir.model.data model. This model contains the data such as the module
name that declares the XML ID, the ID string, the referred model, and the referred ID.

	Every time we use an XML ID on a <record> tag, Odoo checks whether the string is
namespaced (that is, whether it contains exactly one dot), and, if not, it adds the current
module name as a namespace. Then, it looks up whether there is already a record in
ir.model.data with the specified name. If so, an UPDATE statement for the listed
fields is executed; if not, a CREATE statement is executed. This is how you can provide
partial data when a record already exists, as we did earlier.
